Airbnb clone: This is a full stack web project that mimics the functions of airbnb. It utilizes React as the front end, and express.js and Mongodb as the backend servers. The app utilizes three collections of databases to store different kinds of data. To start the program locally, you can use yarn as your package manager and add required packages accoordingly.

wordneighbor: This project mainly uses c++, object oriented design, graph and BFS to complete. It targets on finding the shortest path between each word where a path is defined by two words only differentiated by one character. It also has a makefile that is convient to compile.


data science projects: Those projects are done at UCSB data science classes. They mainly target on using python and jupyter notebook to perform data analysis and data cleaning. Extensive use of plotting techniques are envolved.

Cities' weather: It uses Python flask, html and json file to integrate with weather website api to extract the real-time weather condition based on user's input locations.

Python flask Project:  Built front end web pages with HTML and CSS with Bootstrap library and Jinja template to make the web elegant andinteract with Python backend.Used Python Flask as the backend framework to respond to Post requests from front end and connected to SQLAlchemy database. Made sure Flask Get to the designated HTML pages by using routes.Enabled users to sign on to the web with unique email addresses and passwords, hashed the passwords with Werkzeug for password integrity. Performed CRUD operations on application to allow users to add and delete their personal notes onto the webpages.

Counter Project: Mainly utilized C++ and Makefile to make an interactive console-based program. I redeveloped the Data Structure, Hashmap with a self-defined hash function and operator overloading. The project allows O(1) time complexity to record the user's input. It supports CRUD operations.

Machine Learning on 2K dataset: Cleaned the datasets first and applied several bootstrapping techniques to the dataset. Incorporated good industrial practices such as K-fold cross validation to the dataset to enhance performance. Utilized several Machine Learning models to come up the optimum model structure (such as Random Forest, KNN models
etc. Tuned different hyperparameters in different grids accordingly to create the most optimal setupAchieved a commendable result with the RMSE being 1.82, which is really low since the predicted values range from 0 to 100.

Time Series Data Analysis: Analyzed the dataset by comparing the ACF and PACF functions and apply BoxCox transformation to stabilize the dataset. Model tuned with different SARIMA models to come up with two highest AICcs values. Checked the residuals, Stationarity and Invertibility of the models to finalize with the best one. Invert the BoxCox transformation to get the original dataset, and forecasted with resulted models and the results stayed inside the 95% confidence Intervals.
